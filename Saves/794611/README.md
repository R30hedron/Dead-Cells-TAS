### Routing notes
Brutality focused
#### Prisoners' Quarters:
Balanced Blade in timed door
#### Promenade of the Condemned:

#### Ramparts:
Exit 5 towers after hint; final tower
#### Black Bridge:
Legendary Sinew Slicer
#### Stilt Village / Fractured Shrines:
Fractured Shrines skip likely possible with 1 hyperspeed, however, there is no good launching off point. May be best to aim for two hypers; one off of starting cliff and then a second off of the "q" shaped island on the top right.

Both Stilt Village keys are valid options, easy to handle without central tower skip.
#### Clock Tower:
Key in central tower, exit in first left tower.
#### Clock Room:
Legendary Sinew Slicer
#### High Peak Castle:
Non-"troll shop"; exit on right "upper" branch.

Green - Red - Blue
